## Objective
The goal is to enhance the original dataset with external data sources like weather conditions, geographical information, or other relevant datasets. This enrichment provides a more holistic view of the factors affecting the train operations and allows for a more nuanced analysis.

## How to Use
These notebooks should be run after the initial data preprocessing steps. They fetch, process, and integrate additional data sources with the main SNCB dataset. The enriched dataset is then ready for exploration, analysis, and anomaly detection.
